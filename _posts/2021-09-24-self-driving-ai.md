It seems like biggest barriers to something approximating general AI:

<ol type="a">
<li>Having a "body" that can take in and process all kinds of sensory data</li>
<li>Making decisions based on a human-like theory of mind</li>
<li>Processing power</li>
</ol>

Self-driving cars have the tools and incentives to get past them. Sight, sound, smell, and touch are all useful for determining safety precautions and how best to navigate. Understanding human intention is required to avoid paranoid behavior in crowded settings, and understand human intention requires a theory of mind. And cars are just big enough--and now with powerful enough batteries--to house tons of sensors and computing power.

I know some smart people are working toward general AI, and maybe they think about a human-like robot being the vessel, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if Knight Rider comes first.
